            <h3>First Impressionist Exhibition (1874)</h3>
            <p>The exhibition opened for one month on 15 April 1874, in the studios which the photographer Nadar had
                just vacated on the second floor of 35 Boulevard des Capucines, on the corner of the Rue Daunou and
                which he kindly loaned them. It included more than 200 works, 51 from members of the group and 114
                by other invited artists, most of them friends of Degas. There were thirty participants, of whom
                only Boudin represented the older generations. Manet had refused to join his friends, despite the
                insistence of Degas. Monet presented five canvases and seven sketches; Renoir six canvases including
                "The Box" and "The Dancer"; Cezanne "The New Olympia" and two landscapes of Auvers, one of them "La
                Maison du Pendu"; Berthe Morisot nine paintings, watercolours and pastels; Degas ten paintings,
                pastels or drawings of dancers and racing; and Pissarro and Sisley five landscapes each. Pissarro
                had to fight to get Cezanne and Guillaumin in.</p>

            <h3>Second Impressionist Exhibition (1876)</h3>
            <p>In 1876, the group decided to have a second exhibition, this time at the Durand-Ruel Gallery, 11 rue
                Le Peletier. There were not more than twenty artists exhibiting a total 252 works. Each artist
                exhibited separately: Degas, twenty-four paintings; Monet, eighteen; Berthe Morisot, seventeen;
                Pissarro, twelve; Renoir, fifteen; and Sisley, eight. Many works were loaned by collectors including
                Chocquet and the baritone Faure, who bought Monet's paintings on the advice of Durand-Ruel. Chocquet
                was there every day, trying to explain to visitors the value of his friends' work. Neither
                Guillaumin nor Cezanne, then staying in the Midi region of France, exhibited, but there were several
                newcomers: Caillebotte, Desboutin and Legros.</p>

          <h3>Third Impressionist Exhibition (1877)</h3>
            <p>The third exhibition took place in the month of April 1877, in an empty apartment which Caillebotte
                had rented at 6 rue Le Peletier for the occasion. He was the king-pin of the project, this time
                courageously called "Exhibition of Impressionists" despite opposition from Degas, and which was to
                remain the most significant of all the group's showings. There were 230 works by eighteen painters.
                Monet showed thirty-five paintings, including several of Gare Saint-Lazare, thanks to his collectors
                Hoschede and Dr Bellio, a Rumanian (who had bought "Impression: Soleil Levant"). Pissarro showed
                twenty-three landscapes of Auvers and Pontoise which he had put in white frames after a practice
                introduced by Whistler on the grounds that they would each stand out better. Renoir's contribution -
                "Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette", "The Swing," and portraits of Madame Charpentier, Jeanne Samary
                and Madame Daudet - was a particularly ample one. But those of Sisley and Cezanne were a
                revelation.</p>

            <h3>Fourth Impressionist Exhibition (1879)</h3>
            <p>But the fourth exhibition, put on from 10 April to 11 May 1879, at 28 Avenue de l'Opera, thanks to
                the devotion and perseverance of Caillebotte, is clearly a step back-wards. The influence of Degas
                is preponderant and marked by a return to a neutral title: "Exhibition of a Group of Independent
                Artists". Renoir and Sisley are absent, as is Cezanne, who has settled in Provence. Pissarro and
                Monet dominate the exhibition all the same with thirty-eight and twenty-nine paintings respectively.
                Paul Gauguin appears in the wake of Pissarro. The exhibition is less attacked and has a certain
                success with the public. It even shows a profit which is divided up among the fifteen participants.
                At the Salon which is showing at the same time the place of the new artists is very modest. Cezanne
                and Sisley are rejected.</p>
