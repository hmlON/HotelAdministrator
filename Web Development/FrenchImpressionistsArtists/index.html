                    <h2>Impressionism</h2>
                    <p><strong>Impressionism</strong> is a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose
                        independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s. Impressionist painting
                        characteristics include relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on
                        accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time),
                        ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and
                        unusual visual angles.</p>

                <h3>Vincent van Gogh</h3>
                <p>A Dutch painter who work was more characteristically post-impressionist the exuded raw intensity and
                    emotional honesty using bold colors and searing brush strokes that laid much of the foundation of
                    modern 20th century arts</p>
