                <p align="justify"><strong>Vincent van Gogh</strong> (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch painter who work was more characteristically post-impressionist the exuded raw intensity and emotional honesty using bold colors and searing brush strokes that laid much of the foundation of modern 20th century arts. While his artistic talent showed up as missionary pastor which was to be his vocation, it was not until the 1880s when his interest in the arts finally blossomed when he attended the Academie Royale des Beaus-Arts in Brussels where his aspired to become an artist in the service of God.
                    <br>
                    It was during his stay in Nuenen and Antwerp where his creative works started to gather interest even in Paris. His studies of peasant characters paid off with his first major opus The Potato Eaters and by August 1885, the exhibits of his works were held through the arts dealer Leurs in the Hague.
                    <br>
                    His two years in Nuenen produced almost 200 oil paintings that had somber subjects in earth colors with none of the bright colors that characterized his later works. hen then matriculated his way to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp in 1886 already plagued with poor diet, overwork and excessive smoking.
                    <br>
                    Van Gogh reached the pinnacle of his creative artistry during the last 4 years of his life, starting with a neo-impressionist style of the period along with Paul Signac and Georges Seurat. His fame had been steadily growing since his exhibits in the late 1880s and his suicide in 1890 launched memorial exhibits in Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, The Hague, Cologne, Antwerp and New York that only cemented his place in neo-impressionism alongside Pablo Picasso. Van Gogh’s works are among the most expensive paintings ever auctioned.
