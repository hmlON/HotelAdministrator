                <font size="+2" face="Tahoma">First Impressionist Exhibition (1874)</font><br>
                <p align="justify">The exhibition opened for one month on 15 April 1874, in the studios which the photographer Nadar had just vacated on the second floor of 35 Boulevard des Capucines, on the corner of the Rue Daunou and which he kindly loaned them. It included more than 200 works, 51 from members of the group and 114 by other invited artists, most of them friends of Degas. There were thirty participants, of whom only Boudin represented the older generations. Manet had refused to join his friends, despite the insistence of Degas. Monet presented five canvases and seven sketches; Renoir six canvases including "The Box" and "The Dancer"; Cezanne "The New Olympia" and two landscapes of Auvers, one of them "La Maison du Pendu"; Berthe Morisot nine paintings, watercolours and pastels; Degas ten paintings, pastels or drawings of dancers and racing; and Pissarro and Sisley five landscapes each. Pissarro had to fight to get Cezanne and Guillaumin in.
                    <br>
                From the beginning the exhibition is well patronised, but mainly by a public ready to poke fun at it. Shades of the Salon des Refuses! The art critics come but without taking anything very seriously, without realising what the new style of painting is trying to seek out and achieve. But they do appreciate how it makes a break with traditional painting. On 25 April a bomb bursts in the form of an article in Charivari, in which Louis Leroy hacks it to pieces. But on the occasion of the exhibition the group at least found their name, a title which the painters finished up accepting although they were not satisfied with it because, like all titles, they thought it was incomplete and not expressing the full significance of their aim. Degas, for his part, never agreed to it, preferring the title of independents. Zola would hear of nothing but naturalists. But history finished up ratifying the word of which Monet had become the unwitting godfather:
                    <br>
                <blockquote>"I was asked for a title for the catalogue; I replied, put down "Impressions.'" The painting was called "Impression, Soleil Levant" (Impression, Rising Sun). Thus was born the name Impressionism".</blockquote>
                    <br>
                As often happens a term born in derision ends by assuming a very worthy significance. At the end of a few years the greatest defenders of the group, Theodore Duret and Georges Riviere, adopted the name of the Impressionists and made it famous. "Treating a subject for tones and not for the subject itself, that is what distinguishes the Impressionists from other painters;" wrote Georges Riviere in 1877. And finally the word was quite suitable for that direct painting which is obedient to feeling, which is not realism but which shows nature seen through moderation and in a certain light.
                    <br>
                The exhibition, however, closes with such a loss that the artists have to disband the company they have only just formed, each paying his part of the loss. This aggravated the situation and Renoir persuaded his friends to try a public auction at the Hotel Drouot. This took place on 24 March 1875, with a preface to the catalogue by Burty and with Durand-Ruel as the expert. It included seventy-three works: twenty-one by Sisley, twenty by Monet, twenty by Renoir and twelve by Berthe Morisot. The sales were difficult, often interrupted by demonstrations, and the prices very low. The average sum paid was hardly more than 100 francs a painting. But on this occasion the Impressionists recruited a new supporter, Victor Chocquet, a customs inspector and modest but passionate collector, who first showed a preference for Renoir then, thanks to the active friendship of the latter, for Monet and Cezanne. Chocquet was to play an important role in defence of the Impressionists, alongside Gustave Caillebotte, in their later exhibitions. After his death, in a sale organised by his widow in 1899, were thirty-two paintings by Cezanne, eleven by Monet, eleven by Renoir, five by Manet and one each by Pissarro and Sisley.</p>
